# Project work-in-progress

This is a Machine Learning project that is far from everything I saw at the University by now.

### How many times, during a work-out session, your songs player played a non-idoneous song for what you were doing?
That's a problem which came in my mind during a boxe session, where in the middle of an intense excersise at the punching bag, my songs-player started 
to play a chill song. 

For a first step, I would consider the case where the excersises are timed by a timer which gives us the time of work and rest (for example: 3 minutes of work and 1 minute of rest). In this case the idea is to study all the songs available, and then to choose the best songs we would like in both the cases
of work and rest (for example considering the frequency of a song and finding the best part of the song that can be played during the work session and the
best part that can played during the rest session).
